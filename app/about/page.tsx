                    exploring the intersection of human rights, political

                    power dynamics shape policy outcomes, her research has

                The First American Land Allotment Project began in Professor
                Ritter's seminar on political rights and historical justice.
                While examining case studies of land policy impacts, she and her
                students discovered significant gaps in accessible resources
                that visualized the dramatic transformation of indigenous lands
                through federal policies.

              <p className="text-earth/90 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                "We kept encountering the same challenge," Professor Ritter
                explains. "The data existed in various archives and databases,
                but there was no comprehensive way for communities, researchers,
                or students to see and understand these land changes over time.
                The stories were there, but they needed to be made visible."
              </p>
              <p className="text-earth/90 leading-relaxed">
                This realization led to an initial pilot project that mapped
                allotment patterns in one tribal nation. The positive response
                from both community members and fellow researchers convinced
                Professor Ritter of the need to expand the work into what has
                become the First American Land Allotment Project.

                Professor Ritter's vision for the project emerged from her
                commitment to making historical justice visible and accessible.
                "Understanding land history is essential for addressing
                contemporary inequities," she notes. "But that understanding
                requires tools that help us see patterns and changes that
                occurred over decades or even centuries."

                Under Professor Ritter's leadership, the project has grown from
                a classroom initiative to a comprehensive digital platform. To
                date, the project has mapped allotment histories across multiple
                tribal nations, developed interactive story maps that have been
                used in educational settings from high schools to graduate
                programs, and created open datasets that support ongoing
                research.

                developing new tools for visualizing the connections between
                historical land policies and contemporary issues.

                "This is ongoing work," she explains. "We continue to learn from
                community partners, refine our approaches, and develop new ways
                to make this history accessible and meaningful. The ultimate
                goal is to create resources that serve both communities with
                direct connections to these histories and broader audiences who
                need to understand this critical aspect of American history."
